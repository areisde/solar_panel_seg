# Solar Panel Segmentation

For this project we will be using the following tutorial : https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models.pytorch/blob/master/examples/cars%20segmentation%20(camvid).ipynb

The combination of these frameworks, will allow us to experiment with different machine learning models and data augmentation to increase performance.

We will then report the results and compare to the previous research done on the exact same dataset.
