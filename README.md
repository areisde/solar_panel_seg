# Solar Panel Segmentation

### 1. Projet and objectives
We want to segment solar panels on rooftops. To do so, we were given a dataset from the belgian government, in which some solar panels were segmented.
We want to use the dataset to train different architetures of neural networks, with different parameters and see which combination performs best.

### 2. Tools
For this project we will be inspiring ourselves from the following tutorial : shorturl.at/uxMW9
Thanks to the different libraries used, combined with Pytorch, we will be able to easily implement very different architectures with different parameters and compare them.

Given the dataset is pretty small, we will test data augmentation using a library called 'Albumentations'.
